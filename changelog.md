## Version 1.1 Update

*Please note, the cutscene add-on was updated, you'll need to download the updated files from GameBanana!!!*

- Added consistent switch activation and deactivation sounds.
- Added Sonic Generations' warning sound (Sonic Generations UI option only) and lock on cursor.
- Adjusted sound volumes to match the vanilla quality.

- Added support for all languages.
- Added Sonic Forces-styled boost.
- Added minor music tweaks (restoring the drum at the beginning of Kingdom Valley, fixing the C and D rank jingle delay and Westopolis starts to play when you gain control of Shadow in Tokyo Mission)
- New Chaos Control sounds to be more faithful to legacy games.
- New Chaos Snap sound (uses the one that is used at Shadow's opening cutscene in Sonic '06)
- Added support for Sonic the Hedgehog 3 Movie Pack.
- Added tracks from the album (*Without You, Vengeance Is Mine and Supporting Me) and some fan-made remixes (e.g. Bullet Station Act 2, What I'm Made Of... and etc.)
- Tweaked credits medley to mimic how it was in Sonic Generations.
- Tweaked Mephiles' voice clips to better mimic his original performances. (AI was not used!)
- Added Add-Ons! (GameBanana only)
