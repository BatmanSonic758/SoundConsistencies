## Version 1.1 Update
- Added consistent switch activation and deactivation sounds.
- Added Sonic Generations' warning sound (Sonic Generations UI option only) and lock on cursor.
- Added tweaks for more cutscenes (Arch-enemy Arrival and Reunion with Maria). The final cutscene was also modified but it just adds "Without You".
- Added support for all languages.
- Added minor music tweaks (restoring the drum at the beginning of Kingdom Valley, fixing the C and D rank jingle delay and Westopolis starts to play when you gain control of Shadow in Tokyo Mission)
- New Chaos Control sounds to be more faithful to legacy games.
- New Chaos Snap sound (uses the one that is used at Shadow's opening cutscene in Sonic '06)
- Added support for Sonic the Hedgehog 3 Movie Pack.
- Added tracks from the album (Without You, Vengeance Is Mine and Supporting Me)
- Tweaked credits medley to mimic how it was in Sonic Generations.
- Tweaked Mephiles and Metal Overlord's voice clips to better mimic their original performances. (AI was not used!)
- Added Add-Ons!
